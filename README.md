# MLP-Image-Data-Classification

The assignment consisted of implementing the multilayer perceptron from scratch, applying them to FashionMNIST data sets, analyzing their performance, and evaluating against a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and ResNet algorithm. We found that a one-hidden-layer MLP with 128 hidden units trained with Adam optimizer performed the best among all the experiments. Nonetheless, the ResNet model we implemented on the FashionMNIST dataset did not outperform the other algorithms implemented on the same dataset.
